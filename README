SUBVERTLE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Subvertle is a set of tools to extract, manipulate and synthesize BBC iPlayer
subtitles, created for Culture Hack Day London 2011.

Its main constituents are:
 - python/subvertle/iplayerlib.py   - a Python library to access iPlayer metadata
 - python/subvertle/translate.py    - a translation framework, to iteratively transform
                                      text into different dialects
 - python/subvertle/singSomeText.py - an interface to the Canoris web service, to
 - python/web/subvertle-web.py      - a Flask-based web framework to access, translate
                                      and serve iPlayer subtitles
 - python/web/subvertle-web.py      - a Flask-based web framework to access, translate
                                      and serve iPlayer subtitles

 - greasemonkey/iplayer_subtitles.user.js
                                    - a Greasemonkey (Firefox) script which overlays
                                      subtitles onto iPlayer by interfacing with the
                                      subvertle-web service.
