TODO
* Make screen capture of Human Planet for Vimeo.
* Get permanent webserver set up on translate.subvertle.com
* Test under stress (what happens if video skips/buffers?)
  Might be able to swap out setInterval timer for iPlayer play event callback.
* Less intensive Google Translate calls
* Clean up capitalisation and other quirks in text translator
* Full-screen mode: is it even possible to overlay CSS in full-screen mode?
* Integrate "say" and "sing" modes to use the same API
